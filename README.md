# üëãüèª Hey everyone! Welcome to my GitHub.
Feel free to call me Lia!

## About Me
Since I finished my undergraduate degree, I've been studying various programming languages like Java, Python, PHP, and JavaScript. I worked as a Java programming intern and as a data analyst using Python. Now, I'm looking for a new challenge, aiming to work as a front-end developer. I'm interested in user experience, design, interactivity, layout, colors, and things like that. This is the beginning of a new journey.

## The Journey
This journey feels like a game, and I have some missions to complete before adding badges to this profile. Here are the rules:

1. I need to choose or create a roadmap to learn a selected language.
2. I must complete and publish one basic project, one intermediate project, and one advanced project with the chosen language here on GitHub.
3. I will solve all beginner challenges on Beecrowd using this language.

Let the game begin! üöÄ
